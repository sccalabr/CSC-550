The way I viewed the architecture is as follows:
	Master Distribution Layer - master.c
		This will handle the input from users, CRUD functions
		Decide which nodes get what data, pass messages around
	Master Storage Layer - masterStorage.c
		This will be the index table only. Will be called from the distribution layer
		Should be independent from everything else, distribution layer will handle
		communication with slave nodes
	Master Backup Layer - masterStorage.c
		Will handle restore and flush of the contents on/to disk

	Slave Distribution Layer - slave.c
		This will handle the finding a place to store data, and updating the available
		locations list
	Slave Storage Layer - slaveStorage.c
		This will be the buffer (data array) that everything gets stored in. Will be
		called from the distribution layer
	Slave Backup Layer - masterStorage.c
		Will handle restore and flush of the contents on/to disk
